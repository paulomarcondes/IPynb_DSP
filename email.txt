Hi Paulo,
Yes this is fine, thanks for asking.   Good luck with your DSP studies and let me know if I can answer any questions!

Hello, Mr Smith,

I just stared studying DSP per your book.
I found praise for your book and decided to start my endeavor in DSP through it.

Then I thought that one of the best ways to learn something is to do it, so I decided to also learn some python.
In order to do so, I installed python on my computer and started working on a notebook.

I wish to share it, so others can benefit, and maybe I can learn a bit more from others.
Inspired by http://github.com/unpingco/Python-for-Signal-Processing, 
I set up a code repository at http://bitbucket.org/pmarc/dspg_ipynb

I want to know if this is still considered fair use, or if this is acceptable.
Also, I wish to license my notebooks with a Creative Commons CC-BY-SA. If that is acceptable, please advise.
Obviously, I am linking to your book website.

Yes, I mention "work" in the home page of the repository.
I do work for an oil company as a geophysicist, and have found that my ignorance of DSP hinders my performance.

Thanks,

Paulo Marcondes.
